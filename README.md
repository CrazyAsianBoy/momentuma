Having problem with product layout. Not sure if it's because of the <div class="container-fluid"> row 47? Still trying to find out what's the problem. <br> tag is not helping at all since it's an inline block. Just found out while writting about it here. But wondering why it works with the <footer> tag. Not only that, the "add to cart" button seems to float around and cause a mess if i shrink the browser to a mobile size. Starting from 440px width to 519px the lorem ipsum suddeny float and stick with the product. I'm not sure which code i'm using wrong or maybe i'm lack of bootstrap knowledge. (Goddamn starting to be like a diary). Not only that i just realise that my "container-fluid" is after lorem ipsum but why does the bug on shronk version happen(440px to 519px width{browser width}).
